		<h3 align="center">Welcome to Atlas Musica</h3>
		<h4 align="center">NOTE: This website is currently in BETA</h4>
		<p>That means there will be limited functionality: Links might not work, pages will be blank, etc. Currently 
		the site is meant to display what Atlas Musica is capable of. I have narrowed the scope to focus on Murfreesboro, 
		TN from 2010-2019. This will include: Shows that did and didn’t occur, the bands that lived there, artists that 
		toured through and any other events that occurred within the scope of the music scene. I hope that this peek into 
		the Murfreesboro music scene leads to cooler things for Atlas Musica in the future.</p>
		<p>Check out the <a href="01_about.html">About</a> section to learn what led to the development of the site (and a 
		little info about myelf). Check out the <a href="SB_volunteer.html">Volunteer</a> section to learn how you can help 
		get the site off the ground. You can <a href="SB_Submit.html">Submit</a> any information (photos, flyers, videos, 
		corrections) here. Finally, you can click on either Artists or Venues to check out the site.
		</p>
		
		<h4 align="center">Your opinion matters!!!</h4>
		<p>If you are reading this you are one of the first folks to see Atlas Musica and I appreciate you taking the time 
		 to check it out. This is a passion project created and currently maintained by myself. I say this because I 
		 know how easy it is to overlook obvious design issues while working on a project. If there is anything you see 
		 I could improve or you think is wonky please let me know! You can message me on my social medias or anonymously 
		 through the <a href="SB_Submit.html">Submit</a> form. It would mean the world to hear from you and to let me know 
		 what can be done to make the site an easier and more pleasent experiece. Thank you in advance!
		</p>
		
		
		
		<h4 align="center">DISCLAIMER: Abusers in Music Scenes</h4>
		<p>The goal of Atlas Musica is to document and preserve all aspects of pur music scenes. This also means there will be 
		documentation of awful people/ abusers who may trigger adverse reactions in some users. It is highly likely 
		that certain photos or information will include known abusers. It's important to preserve the history of our scenes 
		while protecting those who have been hurt by said people. If there is any information/ photos/ videos of abusers on the 
		site please know it's safe to reach out to me in the 'Submit' to let me know. The information you provide will be 
		anonymous, private and secure. I will do my best to provide ample warning and protection from glorifying abusers on the 
		site.</p>
